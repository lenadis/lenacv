        <p>I am studying Multimedia Design and Communication at KEA. Multimedia design is the perfect match for me as I like a little bit of everything.</p>
        <p>I'm interested in pursuing a career in Web Development and Web Design.</p>
        <p>I am from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npawmHVaf-E">Iceland</a>, living in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f085YkS8UEo">Denmark</a>.</p>
        <p>I was born in 1988 same year as <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?t=43">this</a> masterpiece was made. Also the same year as my favorite movie, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugUaxot1UgE">Coming to America</a>, came out.
        </p>
        <p>I speak Icelandic, English and my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8VziyktyS0">Danish</a> is getting better although I'm better at understanding than actually speaking. I also speak a bit of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiWtqVtd1Oo">Spanish</a> after travelling for 6 months in South America.</p>
        <p>This website is made using Bootstrap and AngularJS.</p>
